# Google Drive problem FIXED
#### I had a problem with my Google Drive, it took me so long to figure out the solution but in the end it is quite simple. In this repository I will explain you how fixed my GDrive.

#### Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc in your file explorer. Now open "hosts" file as an administrator in your text editor.
#### If your file looks like this:
```# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
  #
  # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
  #
  # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
  # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
  # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
  # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
  # space.
  #
  # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
  # lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
  #       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host
  
  # localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
  #  127.0.0.1       localhost
  #  ::1             localhost
